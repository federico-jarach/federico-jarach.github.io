            <h1>Federico Jarach</h1>
            <p class="tagline">Full-stack ecosystem operator in San Francisco</p>

            <div class="about-content">
                <p><strong>Frontend:</strong> working the room, making intros, activating networks.<br>
                <strong>Backend:</strong> playbooks, platforms, systems that make programs scale.</p>

                <p>Most ops people don't work rooms. Most relationship people don't build systems. I do both — and I make teams better at both.</p>

                <p>At <a href="https://innovitsf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INNOVIT</a> in San Francisco: planned and executed 370+ sessions across 7 cohorts, architected the Notion playbook that scaled us from 4 to 10 cohorts/year, helped build a 320-member alumni community and 700+ mentor network, and made sure founders and teammates had what they needed to succeed. At <a href="https://www.ambrosetti.eu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The European House-Ambrosetti</a>: 74+ events, institutional and corporate clients, from 10 CEOs advisory boards to 2,000-person forums with C-levels and heads of state. Co-founded a cross-border AI GTM studio supporting European founders entering the US. Learning the VC side through VC Lab's Venture Institute.</p>

                <p>I've been the strategist in the room and the person sending the follow-up emails. The one designing the system and the one onboarding the new hire. Whatever the team needs to move forward.</p>

                <p><a href="https://t-hub.technion.ac.il/sumba-en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Technion MBA</a>, no CS degree — but actually building with AI, not just prompting. This site is where I ship those experiments.</p>

                <p class="cta">In SF because this is where the future is being built, bit by bit and atom by atom. I want to see it first, talk about it, and play with it.</p>
